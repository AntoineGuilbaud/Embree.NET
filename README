                                   ==========                                   

Embree.NET is the unofficial C# wrapper for the Embree collection of ray tracing
kernels, and runs under the .NET and Mono runtimes in both 32- and 64-bit modes.

 ===== Introduction ===========================================================

Embree.NET implements the concept of scenes, geometries, meshes and instances in
an OOP fashion, building on top of Embree's interface and adding various runtime
and type checks to make the library as easy and fun to use as possible from C#.

Embree.NET provides the back-end to a renderer, by providing an abstraction of a
scene, composed of one or more instances of "geometries" (which are themselves a
collection of meshes). We suggest using composition to "wrap" geometry instances
over your own "model" or "object" type which can then provide functionality such
as per-mesh materials, textures, and so on - because the wrapper is designed for
this kind of interop, you are able (after some minor work) to seamlessly use any
classes you may have already written with Embree.NET, fluently and elegantly.

A sample renderer is provided with the wrapper, and shows the main ideas used by
the API and how to use the wrapper in your code. It does not demonstrate all the
features of the wrapper, however, and must primarily be used to "get a feel" for
the wrapper and how it works. Note the sample may change considerably over time.

Please decompress the sample models in Sample/Models before building the sample!

 ===== Features (as of Embree 2.2) ============================================

  [x] Geometry instancing
      - supported natively and actually part of how the wrapper is designed;
      - for consistency, the wrapper does not support non-instanced geometry
        (i.e. the topmost scene contains only instanced geometry), where the
        Embree library does - we do not expect this to be a problem;

  [x] Linear motion blur (t = [0, 1])
      - supported, and the wrapper allows per-ray time values;

  [x] Packet ray tracing (1, 4, 8, 16 rays)
      - fully supported by the wrapper, however because Embree does not warn
        about unsupported CPU's (for instance, using 16-ray packet mode when
        you do not have a Xeon processor) we cannot reliably check for error
        conditions such as these, and expect this to be fixed eventually;

  [ ] Buffer sharing
      - not supported at this time;

  [ ] User-defined geometry
      - not supported at this time;

  [ ] Filter functions
      - not supported at this time;

As usual, any and all contributions are welcome!
